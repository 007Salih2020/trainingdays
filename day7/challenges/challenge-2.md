# Basic Kubernetes Concepts

## Prerequisites

In order to be able to store the custom Docker images you will be creating throughout this workshop, we need a container registry. Azure provides its own service for that, the Azure Container Registry. Let's create one via the Azure CLI:

```zsh
$ az group create --name adc-acr-rg --location germanywestcentral
$ az acr create --name adccontainerreg --resource-group adc-acr-rg --sku basic --admin-enabled

# now let's attach the container registry to the cluster 

$ az aks update --resource-group adc-aks-rg --name adc-cluster --attach-acr adccontainerreg
```

## Build a custom image

```zsh
$ docker build -t test:1.0 .
$ docker run -p 8080:80 test:1.0
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see a page with a welcome message.

Now let's push the image to our registry. To be able to interact with our registry, we first need to login.

```zsh
$ ACRPWD=$(az acr credential show -n adccontainerreg --query "passwords[0].value" -o tsv)
$ docker login adccontainerreg.azurecr.io -u adccontainerreg -p $ACRPWD
```

> In this sample, we used the `admin` account of our registry to login - basically with username/password. In secure/production environments, you should not enable the `admin` account on the registry and login via Azure Active Directory: `az acr login -n adccontainerreg`. The token that is issued will be valid for 3 hours.

We are now ready to push the image to our container registry.

```zsh
$ docker tag test:1.0 adccontainerreg.azurecr.io/test:1.0
$ docker push adccontainerreg.azurecr.io/test:1.0
````

You can also build directly within the Azure Container Registry service, in case you don't have Docker on your machine. Let's have try...

```zsh
$ az acr build -r adccontainerreg -t adccontainerreg.azurecr.io/test:2.0 .
```

The command will send the current build context to Azure, kick-off a docker build and add the image to your registry.

## Run your custom image

Now that we have an image in our container registry, let's create a pod. This time, we will be using a YAML manifest.

```yaml
# Content of file myfirstpod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myfirstpod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: adccontainerreg.azurecr.io/test:2.0
    name: myfirstpod
    resources: {}
    ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  restartPolicy: Never
```

Create a file called `myfirstpod.yaml` with the content above and apply it to your cluster.

```zsh
$ kubectl apply -f myfirstpod.yaml
```

Check that everything works as expected.

```zsh
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME         READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
myfirstpod   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          6s
...
...
[after a few seconds]
myfirstpod   1/1     Running             0          17s
```

Also, "describe" the pod to see some more details like status, the node it's running on, events etc.

```zsh
$ kubectl describe myfirstpod
Name:         myfirstpod

## Port-Forwarding

So, the pod is running, but how do we access it?! Let's have a look at one option, that you typically would use in _test/debug_ scenarios. 

With `kubectl` you can "port-forward" a local port to a port on a pod. This is how it works in our case:

```zsh
$ kubectl port-forward myfirstpod 8080:80
```

Our pod is listening on port `80` and we forward our local port `8080` to that one. You can check the result by navigating - once again - to `http://localhost:8080`.

To proof that the requests arrive at the pod, check the logs:

```zsh
$ kubectl logs myfirstpod -f=true
/docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration

## Running multiple instances of our workload

Describe deployments

Still - no way to access our pods. It even got worse, because we now have mutliple pods running. We would need to find out all IP adresses of our pods to being able to send requests to them.

## Services

Describe service types

Add service in front of our pods

Internal access --> use busybox to wget index.html (ClusterIp + NodePort)

LoadBalancer type

## Ingress

Add an ingress controller in front of service
