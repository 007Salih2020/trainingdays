## Day 1 - Goal ##  
On the **first day we'll kick off** the week with **some basics and infrastructure** stuff:  
**Virtual machines, networking and storage** are things you may not need to configure but it's good to have a clue how they work together. 
Ok - your are a developer but still we'll hope you'll find this set of challenges as _"edutaining"_ as possible.  

Thx,  
the team
