# GitHub Actions in Action

In this challenge we will take a first look at GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is
GitHubs built in workflow automation and CI/CD tool.

In this challenges we will start playing around with Actions and in doing so
create a GitHub user profile page with automated deployment.

Let's get started! 💪👩

## A clean slate 🧻

For this challenge let's create a new GitHub repository so nothing comes in the
way of our automation madness.

As an added bonus you can use this challenge to create a GitHub profile page for
your organization or personal github account.

### Create a new repository

On your private or organizational create a new repository. If you want to use
the repository as a profile page make sure to name it:

`<username or organizationname>.github.io`

![create new repository](./images/create-new-repository-1.png)

See an example for naming your repository here:

![detailed view of repository](./images/create-new-repository-2.png)

This allows you to later access this site using your GitHub username or
organizaions name like this:

`https://<username or organizationname>.github.io`

Make sure you create a public repository and leave it empty for now.

:::tip
📝 If you do _not_ want to create a profile page or have one already just
create a new repository with a different name. You will have to enable GitHub
Pages on your repository manually though.

### Create a Hello World on Github Pages

For anything to show up on your GitHub Page you have to create an `index.html`
file on the `main` branch. So let's do just that!

You can create a new file directly on the GitHub website.

![Hint to create new file](./images/create-new-file.png)

Let's write some fancy HTML "hello world":

```html
<!-- index.html -->
Hello World! 🌍
```

And save the file using the commit changes dialog at the very bottom of the
editor window.

A few **minutes** later your profile page will be visibile on:

`https://<username or organizationname>.github.io`

:::tip
📝 If you created a repository with a different name you have to enable
GitHub Pages under your repositories `Settings > Pages`.
:::

Your page should look something like this:

![Hello World website](./images/hello-world.png)

## Action

We'll this is still kind of boring, what about the ACTION?

Let's create one now.

```yaml
name: Hello World!

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  greet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Send a hello world
        uses: actions/github-script@v4.0.2
        with:
          script: |
            github.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: "Hello World! 👋",
              body: "Hello 🌍 from GitHub Actions!"
            });
```

# azdc-training.github.io

Landing page for azdc-training organization - have fun! 🚀

This is a sample README.md where you document your newly created Coding Dreams! 🧚‍♀️ 🧚‍♂️

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
