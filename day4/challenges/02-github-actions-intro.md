# GitHub Actions in Action

In this challenge we will take a first look at GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is
GitHubs built in workflow automation and CI/CD tool.

In this challenges we will start playing around with Actions and in doing so
create a GitHub user profile page with automated deployment.

Let's get started! üí™üë©

## A clean slate üßª - GitHub Pages

For this challenge we will again work on an empty repository so nothing comes in
the way of our automation madness.

We want to also give you a quick tour on GitHub Pages. This feature allows you
to host static websites directly on GitHub, making for a great place to
host your documentation for your project together with it's source code.

GitHub Pages are hosted dependent on the repository name.

After enabling the feature, your page is available under the following link by default:

`https://<username or organization name>.github.io/<repository name`

For each organization and user there is one _special_ repository name `<username or organization name>.github.io` reserved to host the root level GitHub Page
`https://<username or organization name>.github.io/` for you account or
organization.

Let's try this now!

:::tip üìù
As an added bonus you can use this challenge to create a profile,
portfolio or documentation page for your organization or personal github
account.

### Create a new repository

Create a new repository on your private or organizational account, but be careful when naming this repository.

Just like before create a new repository

See an example for naming your repository here:

![detailed view of repository](./images/create-new-repository-2.png)

This allows you to later access this site using your GitHub username or
organizaions name like this:

`https://<username or organizationname>.github.io`

Make sure you create a public repository and leave it empty for now.

:::tip
üìù If you do _not_ want to create a profile page or have one already just
create a new repository with a different name. You will have to enable GitHub
Pages on your repository manually though.

### Create a Hello World on Github Pages

For anything to show up on your GitHub Page you have to create an `index.html`
file on the `main` branch. So let's do just that!

You can create a new file directly on the GitHub website.

![Hint to create new file](./images/create-new-file.png)

Let's write some fancy HTML "hello world":

```html
<!-- index.html -->
Hello World! üåç
```

![Index.html](./images/helloworldindexhtml.png)

And save the file using the commit changes dialog at the bottom of the
editor window.

**Minutes** later your profile page will be visible on:

`https://<username or organizationname>.github.io`

:::tip
üìù If you created a repository with a different name you have to enable
GitHub Pages under your repositories `Settings > Pages`.
:::

Your page should look something like this:

![Hello World website](./images/hello-world.png)

## Action

We'll this is still kind of boring, what about the ACTION?

First let's setup a workflow:

![Workflow Setup](./images/setupworkflow.png)

Let's create one now.

```yaml
name: Hello World!

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  greet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Send a hello world
        uses: actions/github-script@v4.0.2
        with:
          script: |
            github.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: "Hello World! üëã",
              body: "Hello üåç from GitHub Actions!"
            });
```

![Hello World Action](./images/helloworldaction.png)

![Action Running](./images/actionrunning.png)

Afterwards you will see under the `Issues` section a new `Hello World Issue`:

![Hello World Issue](./images/helloworldissue.png)

Then we will add our first README.md:

![Add README.md](./images/AddReadMe.png)

````md
# azdc-training.github.io

Landing page for azdc-training organization - have fun! üöÄ

This is a sample README.md where you document your newly created Coding Dreams! üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:
