# GitHub Actions in Action

In this challenge we will take a first look at GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is
GitHubs built in workflow automation and CI/CD tool.

In this challenges we will start playing around with Actions and in doing so
create a GitHub user profile page with automated deployment.

Let's get started! üí™üë©

## A clean slate üßª

For this challenge let's create a new GitHub repository so nothing comes in the
way of our automation madness.

As an added bonus you can use this challenge to create a GitHub profile page for
your organization or personal github account.

### Create a new repository

On your private or organizational create a new repository. If you want to use
the repository as a profile page make sure to name it:

`<username or organizationname>.github.io`

This allows you to later access this site using your GitHub username or
organizaions name like this:

`https://<username or organizationname>.github.io`

Make sure you create a public repository and leave it empty for now.

:::tip
üìù If you do _not_ want to create a profile page or have one already just
create a new repository with a different name. You will have to enable GitHub
Pages on your repository manually though.

### Create a Hello World on Github Pages

For anything to show up on your GitHub Page you have to create an `index.html`
file on the `main` branch. So let's do just that!

You can create a new file directly on the GitHub website.

Let's write some fancy HTML "hello world":

```html
<!-- index.html -->
Hello World! üåç
```

And save the file using the commit changes dialog at the very bottom of the
editor window.

A few **minutes** later your profile page will be visibile on:

`https://<username or organizationname>.github.io`

:::tip
üìù If you created a repository with a different name you have to enable
GitHub Pages under your repositories `Settings > Pages`.

Your page should look something like this:

![Hello World website](./images/hello-world.png)

## Action

We'll this is still kind of boring, what about the ACTION?

Let's create one now.
