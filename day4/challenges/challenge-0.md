## Create a GitHub organization

A GitHub organization is a shared account where business and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects. Owners and Administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with security and administrative features. In the first part of this challenge we are going to create our own GitHub organization which we use for all challenges today.

üìù _If you don't have a GitHub account, you need to create one. You can create your account [here](https://github.com/join)._

First we need to [login to GitHub](https://github.com/login).

First you have to choose a plan for your organization. For today a free plan is enough.
Next, you need to specify a global unique name for your organization an tell GitHub that the organization belongs to your personal account. After you have set all needed values, click _Next_ and complete the setup. We don't need to add organization members now, because we want to do that in the next part of this challenge.
